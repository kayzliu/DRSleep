# Dimension Reduction Methods Applied to Sleep Stage Analysis (DRSleep)
## Overview

This is a complete procedure of sleep stage analysis with dimension reduction methods. The data is from [St. Vincent's University Hospital / University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database](https://doi.org/10.13026/C26C7D). To run the code, use `main` command in MATLAB.
